# Web Scraping Projects  

Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites by automating the retrieval of information. It is commonly used to gather large datasets for analysis, research, and machine learning applications.  

In these projects, I used BeautifulSoup and Requests, two popular Python libraries, to scrape and build datasets for various machine learning projects. The objective was to collect structured data from different sources to support tasks such as sentiment analysis, chatbot development, and recipe recommendation.  

## Projects  

###  BBC Recipe Scraper  
This script extracts recipes from the BBC Recipe website. The collected dataset was later used to train a machine learning model that suggests recipes based on the ingredients available in the fridge.  

###  Handicraft Items Scraper  
This script scrapes data from Flipkart to extract information about handicraft items. The scraping process is carried out in two stages:  

1. Page-Level Scraping – Navigates through all product listing pages on Flipkart.  
2. Product-Level Scraping – Extracts detailed information, including individual ratings and customer reviews for each product.  

The collected dataset was later used for sentiment analysis based on customer comments and reviews.  

###  Mahindra University Scraper  
This script scrapes data from the Mahindra University website to gather information about its professors. The collected data was used to develop a chatbot for the university's website.
